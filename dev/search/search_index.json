Easy : ro.py's client-based model is intuitive and easy to learn for both the beginner and expert developer. It abstracts away API requests and leaves you with simple objects that represent data types on the Roblox platform. Flexible : ro.py's builtin Requests object allows the user to do things that we haven't already implemented ourselves without dealing with advanced Roblox-specific concepts.

For example, users.roblox.com/v1/users/{userId}/username-history only requires the user ID. Let's say you already have a user ID and you just want their username history, and you don't need other information like their name or display name. For example, this code sends 1 unnecessary request: user = await client . get_user ( 1 ) # we don't need this! async for username in user . username_history (): print ( username ) In this case, we already have their user ID. There's no reason to call get_user here. Instead, we can call get_base_user : user = client . get_base_user ( 1 ) async for username in user . username_history (): print ( username ) This code is functionally identical but won't send any unnecessary requests.","title":"Bases"},{"location":"extensions/","text":"Extensions \u00b6 ro.py-discord \u00b6 ro.py-discord is a library that connects ro.py to verification APIs like Bloxlink and RoVer, allowing you to easily create tools that use ro.py in a Discord context, like a Discord bot. ro.py-server \u00b6 ro.py-server is a FastAPI-based web server that implements core ro.py functionality and allows you to securely interact with Roblox without a proxy, CSRF handling, or CORS limitations.

When you call client.get_XYZ , you can guarantee that you'll always get a new object. Keep this in mind. The events system has been removed. The polling behavior was hard to maintain and is out of scope for this project. ro.py's gamepersistence system has been removed. It may be added in the future. ro.py's trade system has been removed. We have no plans to reimplement it. ro.py's SignalR-based notification system has been removed. It is out of scope for this project but may be added later as an extension. Client.filter_text() has been removed. It may be added back in the future. Client.get_game_by_place_id() and Client.get_game_by_universe_id() have been removed. Instead, use Client.get_place() and Client.get_universe() . The captcha system has been removed, along with methods that used it, including Client.user_login() and Client.get_captcha_metadata() . Client.secure_sign_out() has been removed. All singular Client methods, like get_user() , raise new errors. See Error handling . BaseGroup.get_member() now returns an abstract MemberRelationship representing the relationship between a group and a user. For this reason, it is no longer a coroutine. BaseGroup.get_member_by_username is still a coroutine. The thumbnail system has been rewritten. For this reason, BaseUser.thumbnails no longer exists and you should use Client.thumbnails or BaseXYZ.get_thumbnail methods. Client.get_self() is now Client.get_authenticated_user() . The way objects were structured in ro.py has changed. In the past, objects would be responsible for their own requests with an update method - now they take in data and parse it.

Every single time your computer asks Roblox to do anything - for example, \"give me the name of this user\" - your computer also gives this token to Roblox, and it can look and see if that token is valid. Let's say you're asking Roblox to give you a list of your friends. It'll look at that token and know who you are, and can use that to give you your friends list. When you log out, that token is invalidated. Even if the client holds on to the token, it won't be valid after logging out. This token is called the .ROBLOSECURITY token and you will need one to do anything that you need to be logged in to do on Roblox, including: - getting information about yourself (name, description, ID, etc) - changing avatar - getting friends list - playing games Danger You may have heard of this token before and have been told that you should never, under any circumstances, share this token with anyone - and this is true! This token does give an attacker access to your Roblox account. However, this doesn't mean they gain access to everything - over time, more and more things are being locked behind other verification methods, like 2-step verification. We recommend using an alternate account with only the permissions it needs to limit the destruction an attacker can do. Always enable 2-step verification! The best way to authenticate your ro.py application is to log in to Roblox on the website and then taking the .ROBLOSECURITY token from there. Warning Pressing the \"Log out\" button on the Roblox website invalidates your token, so you should not press this button after grabbing your token. Instead, consider using a private or incognito window and closing it when you are done. To grab your .ROBLOSECURITY cookie, log into your account on the Roblox website and follow the instructions below. Chrome/Chromium-based Firefox You can access the cookie by going to https://www.roblox.com/ , pressing the padlock icon next to the URL in your browser, clicking the arrow next to roblox.com , opening up the \"Cookies\" folder, clicking \".ROBLOSECURITY\", clicking on the \"Content\" text once, pressing Ctrl + A , and then pressing Ctrl + C (make sure not to double-click this field as you won't select the entire value!) Alternatively, you can access the cookie by going to https://www.roblox.com/ , pressing Ctrl + Shift + I to access the Developer Tools, navigating to the \"Application\" tab, opening up the arrow next to \"Cookies\" on the sidebar on the left, clicking the https://www.roblox.com item underneath the Cookies button, and then copying the .ROBLOSECURITY token by double-clicking on the value and then hitting Ctrl + C .

For this reason, this function is essentially just a small filter for BaseUser.get_group_roles() and just iterates through all of the roles until the one for the specified group is found. If you are calling this method multiple times in your code you probably should use BaseUser.get_group_roles() instead.

Do note that you can only generate 3D thumbnails for \"catalog-type\" assets, like hats. asset = await client . get_asset ( 151784320 ) asset_3d_thumbnail = await client . thumbnails . get_asset_thumbnail_3d ( asset ) asset_3d_data = await asset_3d_thumbnail . get_3d_data () print ( \"OBJ:\" , asset_3d_data . obj . get_url ()) print ( \"MTL:\" , asset_3d_data . mtl . get_url ()) print ( \"Textures:\" ) for texture in asset_3d_data . textures : print ( texture . get_url ()) Places \u00b6 To generate place icons, use the get_place_icons() method. place = await client . get_place ( 8100260845 ) place_thumbnails = await client . thumbnails . get_place_icons ( places = [ place ], size = ( 512 , 512 ) ) if len ( place_thumbnails ) > 0 : place_thumbnail = place_thumbnails [ 0 ] print ( place_thumbnail . image_url ) Universes \u00b6 Icons \u00b6 To generate universe icons, use the get_universe_icons() method. universe = await client . get_universe ( 3118067569 ) universe_icons = await client . thumbnails . get_universe_icons ( universes = [ universe ], size = ( 512 , 512 ) ) if len ( universe_icons ) > 0 : universe_icon = universe_icons [ 0 ] print ( universe_icon . image_url ) Thumbnails \u00b6 To generate universe thumbnails, use the get_universe_thumbnails() method. Because each universe can have multiple thumbnails, this method behaves differently. universe = await client . get_universe ( 3118067569 ) universes_thumbnails = await client . thumbnails . get_universe_thumbnails ( universes = [ universe ], size = ( 768 , 432 ) ) if len ( universes_thumbnails ) > 0 : universe_thumbnails = universes_thumbnails [ 0 ] for universe_thumbnail in universe_thumbnails . thumbnails : print ( universe_thumbnail . image_url ) Badges \u00b6 To generate badge icons, use the get_badge_icons() method. badge = await client . get_badge ( 2124867793 ) badge_icons = await client . thumbnails . get_badge_icons ( badges = [ badge ], size = ( 150 , 150 ) ) if len ( badge_icons ) > 0 : icon = badge_icons [ 0 ] print ( icon . image_url ) Gamepasses \u00b6 To generate gamepass icons, use the get_gamepass_icons() method. This example uses get_base_gamepass() because there is no get_gamepass method. gamepass = client . get_base_gamepass ( 25421830 ) gamepass_icons = await client . thumbnails . get_gamepass_icons ( gamepasses = [ gamepass ], size = ( 150 , 150 ) ) if len ( gamepass_icons ) > 0 : icon = gamepass_icons [ 0 ] print ( icon . image_url )","title":"Thumbnails"},{"location":"tutorial/thumbnails/#thumbnails","text":"The client.thumbnails attribute is a ThumbnailProvider object which you can use to generate thumbnails.
